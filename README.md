<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a sample project to automate login functions on https://hudl.com. In this test we will log in with valid email and password, log out. We will try and log in with a bad email and good password and finally we will try to login with a good email and bad password. While doing this we are looking for elements on the page along with verifing data on the page like the page title etc...

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project is for hudl testing

### Prerequisites

Before you start using JavaScript for Selenium automation testing, you need to ensure that your system is installed with the following pre-requisites:

1. NodeJS and NPM. Verify if NodeJS and NPM are already installed in your system by running the commands in terminal</br>
    I recommend using node version less then v18. As I have outlined a bug with v18 in the help section that causes failures.
    ```sh
    node -v 
    ```
    ```sh
    npm -v 
    ```

2. If Node JS (or Node.js) is not present on your machine, you can install the latest LTS version from https://nodejs.org/en/. NPM will be installed along with Node.js. So no need for separate installation..
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

3. For this test you will need to be on latest version of chrome 101+

                "hudlLogin": "./node_modules/.bin/mocha hudlLogin.js"
            },
            "keywords": [

                "nodemon": "^2.0.16",
                "selenium-webdriver": "^4.1.2"
            },
            "devDependencies": {
                "mocha": "^10.0.0"
            }
        }
    ```

    ```sh
    #hudl login email address and password
    export HUDL_CORRECT_EMAIL="yourEmail"
    export HUDL_CORRECT_PASSWORD="yourPassword" 
    ```
    Replace "yourEmail" and "yourPassword" with your own email and password that is registered with https://hudl.com.Failing to add this and/or not having a vaild login will result in the first test failing. 

6. Time for some action‚Ä¶let‚Äôs run the code by giving the following command on the terminal:
